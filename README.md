This project is the final part of Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project on Coursera (ending on March 14th 2016).

This project contains a modified dataset from the human data aggregation project described in the Code Book.

The modified dataset includes the following files:

- tidy.txt
- README.md 
- CodeBook.md
- run_analysis.R

The data set in tidy.txt consists of average values of mean and standard deviations grouped by Activity and Subject. 

The columns are: Subject, Activity, and all columns from the original dataset corresponding to mean and
standard deviation with the "average-" prefix.
